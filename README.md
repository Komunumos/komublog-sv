# Komublog-sv
Komublog is a microblogging platform, but also aims to be a full fledged blogging/social platform in the future.

Our goal is to always be 100% open source and get to a point where it can be easily configured for different uses. Like forums, personal blogs 

This project is built using a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend, and PocketBase(as a framework) for the backend. This is the frontend project.

You can check the running website here: [komublog](https://komu.blog)

## Features
The project is still a **work in progress** current features include:
* creating accounts
* configuring name and avatar
* posting messages
* posting images
* user pages
* limited markdown support
* tagging other users (albeit without a notification center this is quite pointless atm)

## Running and building
If you want to run your own version of komublog you will also need to run the backend project, you can follow the instructions here it [here](https://github.com/Komunumos/komuback).

Since it a sveltekit project you run and build like you would do any other svelte kit project

Install dependencies
```
pnpm install
```

Run locally
```
pnpm run dev
```

Build
```
pnpm run build
```

API Url needs to be configured to point to your pocketbase instance in the config.ts file
```
export default {
    apiUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8090"
}
```
